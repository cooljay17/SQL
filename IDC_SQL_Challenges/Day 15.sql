--### Practice Questions:

--1. Join patients, staff, and staff_schedule to show patient service and staff availability.
select *
from patients p left join staff s on p.service=s.service
left join staff_schedule sh on s.staff_id=sh.staff_id;

--2. Combine services_weekly with staff and staff_schedule for comprehensive service analysis.
select *
from staff s left join services_weekly sw on s.service=sw.service
left join staff_schedule sh on s.staff_id=sh.staff_id;
--3. Create a multi-table report showing patient admissions with staff information.
select *
from patients p left join staff s on p.service=s.service
left join services_weekly sw on s.service=sw.service;
